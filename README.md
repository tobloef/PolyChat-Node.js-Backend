# PolyChat
PolyChat is a simple chat application with multiple backends, each written in a different language. I made this to try out and compare a number of different programming languages. Currently the languages include JavaScript with Node.js, Elixir and Go. The end goal of the project is to be able to choose which language to use for a bigger project I'll be doing in the near future.

I'm already fairly familiar with Node.js and I'm mainly including it as a basis for comparison. I haven't used Go or Elixir before this project, so I'm also using this an opportunity to learn the basics of these languages.

## PolyChat Node.js Backend
This repository contains the Node.js version of the PolyChat backend. It uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the API and [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for the real-time communication.
